		  <li><b>EASILY TELL IF YOUR FRIENDS YOU ARE UP WITHOUT WAKING THEM</b><br>
On your Friends Page, under "Friends Status," you will see a purple UP which means your friend is up and wants to connect, or the grey ZZZ, which means they are asleep. </li><br>
		  <li><b>SAFELY KNOW IF YOU ARE FRIENDS ARE UP AND WANT TO CONNECT</b><br>
On your Friends Page, you get to pick and choose how each friend views your status. Simply toggle "Your Status" to UP to tell your friend that you are up and want to connect or toggle to ZZZ, so they think you are asleep. <br>
<br>
The site will automatically toggle you to ZZZ after 30 min. to ensure you are not woken up if you happen to fall asleep.</li><br>

<li><b>EASILY INVITE FRIENDS</b><br>
Once you have logged in, click on the INVITE link on the top of the page to invite friends. The more friends you invite the fuller your nights will be. </li>

 <h3 class="text-left">Transcript For Video</h3>
      <p class="text-left">Welcome to Noctis Alba, a website where night owls can alert their friends that they are up and want to connect.</p>
        <p class="text-left">Tonight we are going to show how easy it is to invite friends and get the connections flowing to make your sleepless nights an opportunity rather than something that needs to be fixed.</p>
          <p class="text-left">
          We are starting on the invite page since this is where you will need to begin your journey so you create a list of friends you can communicate with. Simply enter in their email address and last name and hit confirm. Here is a sample of the email they will get inviting them to join. Once they Accept your invitation, they will show up on your contacts list, which you can view when you click on the Friends link on the main menu. 
          </p>
		<p class="text-left">
          This is a sample of user who has a couple friends who already accepted her invitation. As you can see on the far left, is the user, Julie's status. This is where you would use the toggle to tell your friends if you are up and want to connect or not. On the right hand side is the list of your contacts and their status next to their name. 
          As you can see here, Rachel is up for a chat as well. Now Julie knows she can reach out to Rachel and have a laugh. Rachel always makes her laugh.
